**Overview of the analysis:**

The purpose of this analysis was to work with W. Avy to make a weather analysis on his weather dataset to help him decide if he should open a surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu. He wanted to know if his business he’s deciding to open would be sustainable year-round. He wanted me to help him get more information about the temperature trends by doing this analysis, which is why he specifically asked for the temperature data for the summer months of June and winter months of December in Oahu.

**Results:**
- The highs for both months are both very similar. The max temperature during the summer month of June is 85 degrees, while the max temperature during the winter month of December is 83 degrees. This means there is only a two degree temperature difference when comparing the temperatures for the months June and December.

- The lows for both months are also similar.  The minimum temperature during the summer month of June is 64 degrees, while the minimum temperature during the winter month of December is 56 degrees. There is only has an eight degree difference when comparing these two months. It’s not a major change in temperatures compared to other cities around the world.

- The average temperature during June is 74 degrees while the average temperature during December is 71 degrees. Since these average temperatures are only a three degree difference, that would mean it is not a major temperature difference even though these two seasons are complete opposite season types.

**Summary:**

According to the table shown above, the maximum temps, minimum temps, and the average temps are about the same when comparing both months and seasons. Since the average June and December temperatures are about the same, this means W.Avy should open his surf and ice cream shop business, since it could be sustainable year-round.

Two additional queries we should perform to gather more weather data for June and December would be a query to find the average temperature by station and a query for precipitation levels. 

We should make a query to find the average temperature by station because it would be a more accurate temperature near the station people visit, instead of only knowing the overall average temperature in Oahu. One station's average temperature may be a lot colder than the other stations, so knowing this can help W.Avy decide if his will be successful. Making a query to find the average temperature by station would help make the data for W.Avy more personalized for his area alone, which would be similar to what we did in the climate_analysis file.

We should also make a query to find the precipitation levels in Oahu because the chance of rain might deter people from visiting a surf and ice cream shop often. Most people would want to go out for those types of items and treats on a sunny day, but if it rains a lot, then they would not want to go outside. Having a query to find precipitation levels is necessary because right now from the data we have, we do not know if it was raining during the months where the weather was hot since it is possible for it to rain when it is hot outside too.
